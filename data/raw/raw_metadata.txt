This folder contains the datasets used to conduct Log-Rank Tests and construct survival plots. Each dataset contains:
- The larva subject ID
- The time taken (measured in days) for the larvae to die. Larvae that didn't die during the observation period are noted as having a "time" measurement of 9.
- The status of each larva, where 1 indicates a death and 0 indicates a censored observation (the larvae was still alive at the completion of the observation period)
- The treatment group assigned for each larva. More detailed information on the nature of treatment groups is outlined in the accompanying metadata file for each dataset.
