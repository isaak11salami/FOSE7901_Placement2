This dataset contains the survival data of the antifungal efficacy assay. Details pertaining to "subject_ID", "time" and "status" are described in the accompanying document, "raw_medata".

In this assay, each Galleria mellonella larva was injected with a dose of 10^5 CFU/larva of Candida albicans SC5314. Each treatment group of larva received 10µL of either an antifungal treatment, or a negative control of 10mM Tris Buffer. 
Compounds/peptides used in each treatment were:
Amphotericin B (AmB)
Lactoferrin (LF)
Lactofungin (LFG)
Lactofungin N-truncation, Linear (LNL)
Lactofungin C-truncation, Linear (LNL)

Concentrations of each treatment were as follows:
AmB (124µg/mL)
AmB (124µg/mL) + LF (1024µg/mL)
AmB (124µg/mL) + LFG (4.16µg/mL)
AmB (124µg/mL) + LNL (0.72µg/mL)
AmB (124µg/mL) + LCL (0.96µg/mL)
LF (1024µg/mL)
LFG (4.16µg/mL)
LNL (0.72µg/mL)
LCL (0.96µg/mL)
Tris Buffer (10mM)
